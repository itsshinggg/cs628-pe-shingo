I have created Resume.js file, which the function component gets called in App.js.
The Resume.js function component is responsible to show all the information of the "resume", which uses h1, h2, h3, and paragraph tags. 
The function component does not take any user inputs and therefore the data is static. 
In terms of its style, the only added thing was its background color to match the requirement.
