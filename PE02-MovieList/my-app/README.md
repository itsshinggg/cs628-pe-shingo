# PE02

This project is to list movies based on genres.
At first, it shows every movies regardless of genres, but once a user chooses a genere through the drop down menu, it only shows the movies with the selected genre.
What is happening behind the scene is that once a genre is selected, the movie "cards" are filtered and only matching movies are rendered.
In addition, when each card is clicked, it triggers the onClick function and it alerts users with movie titles. 
The style is kept simple.
