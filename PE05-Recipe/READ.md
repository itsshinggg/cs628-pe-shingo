The Recipe Management Web Application follows the input-process-output model seamlessly. Users provide input by entering recipe details like name, ingredients, and instructions through input fields. Additionally, URL parameters help identify and fetch specific recipe data. The program processes this input by retrieving and structuring data from a remote server through HTTP requests and dynamically displaying recipe information. It manipulates data when users add or update recipes, sending the information to the server. The user interface allows for smooth interaction, enabling users to view, update, and navigate between different recipe views. As output, the program displays lists of recipes with their names and provides detailed views, success messages for data additions or updates, and handles any errors gracefully. This intuitive web application effectively manages recipes, delivering a seamless user experience.
